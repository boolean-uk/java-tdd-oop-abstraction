# Exercise 2
```
As a system administrator,
I want my users to have to create a user account with an email address and a password.

I want them to receive an "invalid password" message if they provide a
password less than 8 characters in length.

I want them to receive an "invalid email" message if they provide an email
address without an @ symbol in it.

I want new accounts to be disabled by default until I manually set them as enabled.

I want users to know if they are able to log in or not based on whether their
account is enabled or disabled.
